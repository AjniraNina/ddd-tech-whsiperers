        "prompt": "Create a single-page RPG game where the player navigates an ASCII map, encounters randomized scenarios, and makes strategic decisions based on limited turns and character variables. The game mechanics and layout are defined below, with specific details on integrating an LLM for generating the ASCII map, scenarios, and encounter outcomes.\n\nGame Overview\n\nThe game revolves around a character with three core variables: Strength, Charisma, and Intelligence. The player uses on-screen directional buttons to move their character (represented by an icon) around an ASCII-generated map. Each move deducts one turn, and the player must strategize to reach an exit within a limited number of turns. The goal is to balance risk and safety when interacting with scenarios, which range in difficulty from 0 to 9.\n\nComponents\n\n1. Character Variables:\n\nStrength: Determines success in physically demanding scenarios.\n\nCharisma: Determines success in social or persuasive scenarios.\n\nIntelligence: Determines success in knowledge-based or logical scenarios.\n\nEach variable can increase or decrease based on outcomes of scenario encounters.\n\n\n\n2. Map Generation:\n\nThe map is auto-generated by the LLM as an ASCII map, with each cell potentially containing a number from 0 to 9, representing scenario difficulty (0 being the safest and 9 being the hardest).\n\nMovement: The player uses directional buttons (up, down, left, right) to navigate the map one cell at a time. Each movement deducts a turn.\n\n\n\n3. Scenario Encounters:\n\nEach cell with a scenario (numbered 0 to 9) opens a unique encounter when the player enters it. The encounter text is dynamically generated by the LLM, based on:\n\nThe difficulty rating (0-9) of the cell.\n\nThe player\u2019s current variable values.\n\n\nEach scenario has three decision options:\n\nOption 1 (Gamble): The highest risk/reward choice, linked to a specific character variable (e.g., Strength, Charisma, or Intelligence). The player rolls a randomized value, and success depends on a minimum threshold based on scenario difficulty. If successful, the chosen variable significantly increases; if failed, the variable decreases.\n\nOption 2 (Mild Gain): Provides a guaranteed minor increase to one of the variables. It is designed as a safer option, giving the player a steady, lower-risk progression.\n\nOption 3 (Mild Gain): Another guaranteed minor increase to a different variable, offering a second safe choice.\n\n\n\n\n4. Risk and Reward System:\n\nTo win, players must carefully balance risk and reward:\n\nHigh-Risk Option: Choosing the high-risk option with a chance to greatly boost a variable but potentially suffer a setback if they fail.\n\nSafe Paths: Taking multiple mild gains may not provide enough variable growth to succeed by the exit, encouraging calculated risks.\n\n\nTurn Limitation: The player has a limited number of turns, making it essential to plan each move wisely, balancing safe moves and gambles based on variable status and scenario difficulty.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Instructions for Implementation\n\n1. User Interface:\n\nMap Display: Show an ASCII map where each cell is labeled with numbers 0-9. The player icon should be visually distinguishable on the map.\n\nDirectional Buttons: Up, Down, Left, Right buttons on the screen allow the player to move around the map. Each press moves the character one cell and deducts a turn.\n\nVariable Display: Display current values of Strength, Charisma, and Intelligence prominently on the screen, updating in real-time based on scenario outcomes.\n\n\n\n2. LLM Integration:\n\nMap Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate a new ASCII map at the start of each game, with cells populated by random difficulty values (0-9). The map layout should vary with each playthrough.\n\nScenario Text Generation: When the player enters a scenario cell:\n\nThe LLM generates a brief scenario description, incorporating the difficulty level and the player's current variables to create context.\n\nExample prompt for LLM: \u201cGenerate a scenario for a difficulty level 7, taking into account a character with Strength: 4, Charisma: 6, and Intelligence: 3. Include one high-risk, high-reward option and two safe options with mild gains.\u201d\n\n\nOutcome Determination: When the player selects an option, the LLM calculates the outcome based on:\n\nFor the gamble option: Roll a random number and adjust it based on the character\u2019s relevant variable. Compare this against a difficulty threshold.\n\nIf successful, increase the variable significantly; if failed, decrease it.\n\nFor the two safe options: Apply a small, guaranteed increase to the relevant variable without failure risk.\n\n\n\n\n3. Game Logic:\n\nTurn Count and End Conditions: Track the number of turns remaining, displaying a countdown prominently on the screen. If the player reaches the exit within the allowed turns, they win. If they run out of turns, they lose.\n\nWinning Condition: To win, the player must navigate the map, accumulate enough variable points, and reach the exit, ensuring that their variables are high enough to succeed in high-difficulty scenarios that block the path near the exit.\n\n\n\n4. Progress Tracking and Feedback:\n\nDisplay feedback after each scenario (e.g., \u201cStrength increased by 3!\u201d or \u201cCharisma decreased by 2.\u201d).\n\nUpdate the variable stats and remaining turn count after each interaction.\n\nThe game ends if there are no more turns to go or player makes it to the exit",

The goal is to balance risk and safety when interacting with scenarios, which range in difficulty from 0 to 9.\n\nComponents\n\n1. Character Variables:\n\nStrength: Determines success in physically demanding scenarios.\n\nCharisma: Determines success in social or persuasive scenarios.\n\nIntelligence: Determines success in knowledge-based or logical scenarios.\n\nEach variable can increase or decrease based on outcomes of scenario encounters.\n\n\n\n2. Map Generation:\n\nThe map is auto-generated by the LLM as an ASCII map, with each cell potentially containing a number from 0 to 9, representing scenario difficulty (0 being the safest and 9 being the hardest).\n\nMovement: The player uses directional buttons (up, down, left, right) to navigate the map one cell at a time. Each movement deducts a turn.\n\n\n\n3. Scenario Encounters:\n\nEach cell with a scenario (numbered 0 to 9) opens a unique encounter when the player enters it. The encounter text is dynamically generated by the LLM, based on:\n\nThe difficulty rating (0-9) of the cell.\n\nThe player\u2019s current variable values.\n\n\nEach scenario has three decision options:\n\nOption 1 (Gamble): The highest risk/reward choice, linked to a specific character variable (e.g., Strength, Charisma, or Intelligence). The player rolls a randomized value, and success depends on a minimum threshold based on scenario difficulty. If successful, the chosen variable significantly increases; if failed, the variable decreases.\n\nOption 2 (Mild Gain): Provides a guaranteed minor increase to one of the variables. It is designed as a safer option, giving the player a steady, lower-risk progression.\n\nOption 3 (Mild Gain): Another guaranteed minor increase to a different variable, offering a second safe choice.\n\n\n\n\n4. Risk and Reward System:\n\nTo win, players must carefully balance risk and reward:\n\nHigh-Risk Option: Choosing the high-risk option with a chance to greatly boost a variable but potentially suffer a setback if they fail.\n\nSafe Paths: Taking multiple mild gains may not provide enough variable growth to succeed by the exit, encouraging calculated risks.\n\n\nTurn Limitation: The player has a limited number of turns, making it essential to plan each move wisely, balancing safe moves and gambles based on variable status and scenario difficulty.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Instructions for Implementation\n\n1. User Interface:\n\nMap Display: Show an ASCII map where each cell is labeled with numbers 0-9. The player icon should be visually distinguishable on the map.\n\nDirectional Buttons: Up, Down, Left, Right buttons on the screen allow the player to move around the map. Each press moves the character one cell and deducts a turn.\n\nVariable Display: Display current values of Strength, Charisma, and Intelligence prominently on the screen, updating in real-time based on scenario outcomes.\n\n\n\n2. LLM Integration:\n\nMap Generation: Prompt the LLM to generate a new ASCII map at the start of each game, with cells populated by random difficulty values (0-9). The map layout should vary with each playthrough.\n\nScenario Text Generation: When the player enters a scenario cell:\n\nThe LLM generates a brief scenario description, incorporating the difficulty level and the player's current variables to create context.\n\nExample prompt for LLM: \u201cGenerate a scenario for a difficulty level 7, taking into account a character with Strength: 4, Charisma: 6, and Intelligence: 3. Include one high-risk, high-reward option and two safe options with mild gains.\u201d\n\n\nOutcome Determination: When the player selects an option, the LLM calculates the outcome based on:\n\nFor the gamble option: Roll a random number and adjust it based on the character\u2019s relevant variable. Compare this against a difficulty threshold.\n\nIf successful, increase the variable significantly; if failed, decrease it.\n\nFor the two safe options: Apply a small, guaranteed increase to the relevant variable without failure risk.\n\n\n\n\n3. Game Logic:\n\nTurn Count and End Conditions: Track the number of turns remaining, displaying a countdown prominently on the screen. If the player reaches the exit within the allowed turns, they win. If they run out of turns, they lose.\n\nWinning Condition: To win, the player must navigate the map, accumulate enough variable points, and reach the exit, ensuring that their variables are high enough to succeed in high-difficulty scenarios that block the path near the exit.\n\n\n\n4. Progress Tracking and Feedback:\n\nDisplay feedback after each scenario (e.g., \u201cStrength increased by 3!\u201d or \u201cCharisma decreased by 2.\u201d).\n\nUpdate the variable stats and remaining turn count after each interaction.\n\nThe game ends if there are no more turns to go or player makes it to the exit",
